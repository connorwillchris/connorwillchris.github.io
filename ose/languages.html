    <h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>
        The native languages spoken by a player character are determined by the
        <a href="character-classes.html">character's class</a>.
        These typically include the common tongue and an
        <a href="alignment.html">alignment</a>
        language. Character's with a high INT may learn additional languages (see
        <a href="ability-scores.html">Ability Scores</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>The Common Tongue</h2>
    <p>
        The common tongue (sometimes simply called
        <b>Common</b>)
        is a language which is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races—as well as many monsters—are able to speak Common.

    <p>
        In some settings, the
        <a href="the-referees-role.html">referee</a>
        may decide that different cultures in the campaign world use their own language, instead of Common. In this case, characters must choose to speak Common or a specific regional language.
