    <h1>Savage Epoch</h1>
    <i>Version: 0.1.0-alpha</i>
    <p>
        Savage Epoch is a worldbuilding project for my
        home D&D games. It was made using the Gygax 75
        challenge.
    </p>

    <h2>The Setting Concept</h2>
    <p>
        The world is set from the ashes of the old
        world. It is inspired by the mythological
        apocalypse "Ragnarok" from Norse Mythology.
        There are many inspirations to Norse Mythology,
        including Mythologically and magically.
    </p>
    <p>
        The world also contains ancient technology
        from the old world. This technology is so weird
        that it borders on magical (and in some cases
        it is).
    </p>

    <h3>Sources of Inspiration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Horizon Zero Dawn</li>
        <li>Dr. Stone</li>
        <li>Thor Ragnarok (asthetically)</li>
    </ul>
