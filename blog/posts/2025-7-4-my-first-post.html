    <h1>My First Post!</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to my first blog post! I am super
        excited to get this journey underway, and
        talk about my projects and worldbuilding
        with you guys :)
    </p>

    <h2>What this is</h2>
    <p>
        This is mostly just a place to vent
        frustrations or a place to chat with everyone.
        I mostly want to focus on worldbuilding and
        writing as I grow my audience, and (possibly)
        do commissions for worldbuilding projects, such
        as conlangs and other such tasks.
