    <h1>Creating a Character</h1>
    <p>
        To create a character, you'll first need a character sheet—a sheet of paper on which to record all information about the new character.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Roll Ability Scores</h2>
    <p>
        Roll 3d6 for each of your character's ability scores: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma. See
        <a href="./ability-scores.html">Ability Scores</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Sub-Par Characters</h3>
    <p>
        If you roll a character with very poor ability scores—for example an 8 or less in every score or an extremely low rating in more than one ability—the
        <a href="">referee</a>
        may allow you to discard the character and start again. 
    </p>

    <h2>2. Choose a Class</h2>
    <p>
        Select one of the classes available (see
        <a href="./character-classes.html">Character Classes</a>),
        bearing in mind the minimum ability score requirements of some classes. The chosen class determines your character's race—unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is human.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Adjust Ability Scores</h2>
    <p>
        If you wish, you may raise your character's
        <a href="./game-statistic.html">Prime Requisite</a>(s)
        of your character by lowering other (non-prime requisite) ability scores. For every two points by which an ability score is reduced, one point may be added to a prime requisite. The following restrictions apply:
        <ul>
            <li>Only Strength, Intelligence, and Wisdom may be lowered in this way.</li>
            <li>No score may be lowered below 9.</li>
            <li>
                Some
                <a href="./character-classes.html">
                    character classes
                </a>
                may have additional constraints.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>4. Note Ability Score Modifiers</h2>
    <p>
        Now that your character’s ability scores are fixed, make a note of any associated bonuses or penalties (see
        <a href="ability-scores.html">
            Ability Scores
        </a>).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Note Attack Values</h2>
    <p>
        The level progression chart for your character's class lists your THAC0 score. This indicates your chance of hitting opponents in combat, as determined by the
        <a href="combat-tables.html">Attack Matrix</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        For quick reference, it is convenient to look up the values in the attack matrix row corresponding to character's THAC0 (determined by class and level) and record them on your character sheet. 1st level characters have a THAC0 of 19 [0], resulting in the attack values shown below.
    </p>

    <h3>Ascending AC (Optional Rule)</h3>
    <p>
        If using the optional rule,
        <a href="game-statistic.html">Ascending AC</a>,
        record your attack bonus on your character sheet, instead of the attack matrix quick reference.
    </p>

    <h4>1st Level PC Attack Values</h4>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Attack Roll</th>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>11</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>13</td>
            <td>14</td>
            <td>15</td>
            <td>16</td>
            <td>17</td>
            <td>18</td>
            <td>19</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>AC Hit</th>
            <td>9</td>
            <td>8</td>
            <td>7</td>
            <td>6</td>
            <td>5</td>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>0</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>6. Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities</h2>
    <p>
        Record any special abilities possessed by your character as a result of their class, as well as your character's
        <a href="saving-throws.html">saving throws</a>.
        If your character has a
        <a href="spell-book.html">spell book</a>,
        ask your referee which
        <a href="spells.html">spells</a>
        are recorded in it. The referee may allow you to choose.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Roll Hit Points</h2>
    <p>
        Determine your character’s hit points by rolling the die type appropriate to the chosen class. Modifiers for high or low Constitution apply (see
        <a href="ability-scores.html">Ability Scores</a>).
        Your character always starts with at least 1 point, regardless of CON modifier.
    </p>

    <h3>Re-Rolling 1s and 2s (Optional Rule)</h3>
    <p>
        If your roll for hit points comes up 1 or 2 (before applying any CON modifier), the referee may allow you to re-roll. This is in order to increase the survivability of 1st level PCs.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Choose Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        Decide whether your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic (see
        <a href="alignment.html">Alignment</a>)
        and note this on your character sheet.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Note Known Languages</h2>
    <p>
        Your character's native languages are listed in the class description. This always includes the common tongue and the character's alignment language-see
        <a href="languages.html">Languages</a>.
        Characters with high INT may also choose additional languages from the list of languages available in the setting.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Buy Equipment</h2>
    <p>
        Your character starts play with 3d6 x 10 gold pieces (see
        <a href="wealth.html">Wealth</a>).
        You may spend as much of this money as you wish to equip your character for adventure, consulting the equipment lists under
        <b>Equipment and Services.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Remember:</b>
        Your chosen class may restrict your use of some equipment (e.g.
        <a href="weapons-and-armor.html">weapons and armor</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>11. Note Armor Class</h2>
    <p>
        Your character's Armor Class is determined by two factors:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Armor:</b>
                The armor worn determines your character's base AC. See the equipment lists under
                <a href="weapons-and-armor.html">armor</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Dexterity:</b>
                See
                <a href="ability-scores.html">
                    Ability Scores
                </a>.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Unarmored AC</h3>
    <p>
        If your character has no armor, their base AC is 9 [10].
    </p>

    <h2>12. Note Level and XP</h2>
    <p>
        Your character begins play at 1st level with 0 XP.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Name Character</h2>
    <p>
        Finally, choose a name for your character. You are now ready for adventure!
