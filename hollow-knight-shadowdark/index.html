    <h1>Hollow Knight - Shadowdark</h1>

    <h2>The world of the Ancient Crevasse</h2>
    <p>
        This world is inhabited by bug-like creatures. They are sentient and live in the
        <b>Ancient Crevasse,</b>
        which is a giant crevasse inside a rock face. The rock face is akin to giant mountains that are impassible.
    </p>
    <p>
        The world has been in shambles for many years and it's been ravenged by some unknown plague that the residents of this now forsaken world called the "dark ages."
    </p>

    <h2>Specific Locations in the Ancient Crevasse</h2>
    <h3>The Forgotten Glade</h3>
    <p>
        The
        <b>Forgotten Glade</b>
        is where the players start out, and live originally. This is a small town, compared to the other cities and locations but is still generously populous. The
        <b>Forgotten Glade</b>
        is set in a shamble of an old castle that has been ravenged by time, and no longer resembles a castle. The residents here have set up various and the resident currency is
        <b>Geo.</b>
    </p>

    <h3>Unclimbable Mountains</h3>
    <p>
        The
        <b>Unclimbable Mountains,</b>
        like the name implies, are mountains that are unclimbable by everyone (including the players.) According to everyone living in the
        <b>Ancient Crevasse,</b>
        this is the only place where living bugs can exist in the world.
    </p>

    <h3>The Crypt</h3>
    <p>
        <b>The Crypt</b>
        is known by the bug residents of the Forgotten Gardens as a dangerous labrinth of tunnels, traps and many other dangers. There are also rumors of large amounts of Geo and treasures beyond belief to be found in the crypt.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Crypt exists entirely underground. It is the combination of many different centuries of rampaged history, and environmental collapse, like earthquakes and floods. The Crypt stands as an expample of what life used to be like for the inhabitants of the Ancient-Crevasse.
