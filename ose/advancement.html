    <h1>Advancement</h1>
    
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        All characters who survive an adventure and return to safety gain experience points (XP) due to any treasure recovered or monsters defeated. XP is awarded by the
        <a href="the-referees-role.html">referee</a>
        (see <a href="awarding-xp.html">Awarding XP</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>Prime Requisite Modifiers</h2>
    <p>
        Characters with especially low or high scores in their class’ prime requisites receive a bonus or penalty to XP earned (see
        <a href="ability-scores.html">ability scores</a>).
        These modifiers are applied to the total XP gained by each character following an adventure.
    </p>

    <h2>Leveling Up</h2>
    <p>
        When a character gains enough XP to reach the next experience level, the player should consult the description of the
        <a href="character-classes.html">character's class</a>
        and note any improvements in saving throws, attack probabilities, spells per day, and other class abilities. If the character's Hit Dice increase, a new Hit Die of the specified type should be rolled and the result added to the character’s maximum hit point total.
    </p>

    <h2>Maximum XP in one session</h2>
    <p>
        Characters cannot advance more than one level in one session. Any additional XP that would take a character two or more levels above their current level are lost, leaving the character at 1 XP below the total for the next level. 
    </p>

    <h1>Level Titles</h1>
    <p>
        In some campaigns, characters gain the right to bear certain titles as they advance in level. Such titles may be granted by the guilds, colleges, or temples that PCs are associates of. Level titles often vary greatly between campaign worlds, but the following lists may be used as inspiration:
