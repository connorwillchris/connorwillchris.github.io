    - ijo sewi / ijo pona: divine being / being of benefit
    - ijo kiwen insa / ijo pi pali kiwen: inside rock being / being of rock-working
    - ijo suli: tall being (suli also meaning “important” amuses me as elves tend to be depicted self-important)
    - ijo utala: being of battle
    - ijo lili: little being
    - ijo pi wawa nasa: being of strange power
    - ijo len/ ijo pi kama jo: hidden being / being of taking (“becoming having”)
