    <h2>Common Knowledge</h2>
    <h3>The Free City of Long Bargo</h3>
    <p>
        The jewel of the Plains. Renowned for its freedom and
        lawlessness. Power is held by three great temples. All three
        are corrupt and unsympathetic.
    </p>

    <h3>The White Temple</h3>
    <p>
        They worship Vandoh, the Goddess of Wisdom, Patience,
        Self-improvement, and the powers behind the sun.
    </p>

    <h3>The Red Temple</h3>
    <p>
        They worship Shendormu, the God of Fungus, Mindlessness,
        and Community.
    </p>

    <h3>The Temple of True Power</h3>
    <p>STRENGTH IS HOLY. SIZE IS SACRED.</p>

    <h2>Secrets</h2>
    <h3>The Lamb</h3>
    <p>
        One of the secrets that the White Temple keeps. They call it
        the Lamb because it was born of a sheep. It is a holy child of
        Vandoh. Eluding the Lamb comprises the first half of this
        adventure.
    </p>

    <h3>The Raid</h3>
    <p>
        A decade ago, a militia attacked the Red Temple, attempting

        to infiltrate through the crypts. They were the Twelve-
        Fingered Hand, a brotherhood of knights closely aligned

        with the White Temple. The Hand failed. Many were killed.
        Many were entombed. Some of them are ghouls now.
