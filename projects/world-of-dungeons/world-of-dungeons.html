    <h3>Rolling the Dice</h3>
    <p>
        <b>When you attempt something risky,</b>
        sum 2d6 and add one of your attribute scores,
        based on the action you're taking. (The GM
        will tell you some of the possible
        consequences before you roll, so you can
        decide if it's worth the risk or if you want
        to revise your action.)
        <b>A total of 6 or less is a miss;</b>
        things don't go well and the risk turns out
        badly.
        <b>A total of 7-9 is a partial success;</b>
        you do it, but there's some cost, compromise,
        retribution, harm, ect.
        <b>A total of 10 0or more is a full
        success;</b>
        you do it without complications. And
        <b>a total of 12 or more is a critical
        success;</b>
        you do it perfectly to some benefit or
        advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>SKILLS:</b>
        If you have an applicable skill, you can't
        miss. A roll of 6 or less counts as a partial
        success, but with a bigger compromise or
        complication than a 7-9 result.
    </p>

    <h3>The Die of Fate</h3>
    <p>
        <b>Sometimes the GM will roll the die of
        fate to see how the situation is
        established.</b>
        Low numbers are ill-fortune, high numbers are
        good fortune (or at least not misery). The die
        of fate might be rolled to established the
        weather, indicate a random NPC's general
        attitude, or to determine if a wandering
        monster appears. The GM may also roll the die
        of fate if the PCs take some action for 
        which sheer chance is the only factor in the
        outcome.
