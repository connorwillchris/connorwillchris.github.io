    <h1>Alignment</h1>

    <p>
        Alignments are cosmic principles that represent broad world views. All beings are categorised under one of three alignments: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Law:</b>
        The belief in goodness, order, truth, and justice as the natural order of the universe. Lawful beings are trustworthy, believe in protecting others, and act for the good of the group. They obey the rules of society and strive for fairness and justice. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Neutrality:</b>
        The belief in a balance between the forces of Law and Chaos, with neither side becoming dominant. Neutral beings will cooperate with others as long as it is not to their own detriment. They treat others as they are themselves treated, and believe in living by their own talents, rather than relying on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Chaos:</b>
        The belief in evil and the meaninglessness and randomness of the universe, wherein the individual’s selfish desires are utmost. Chaotic beings lie and use others as is expedient to their own ends, with no concern for the good of the group. They casually break laws, and are driven by whims and the belief in luck.

    <h2>Revealing Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        The player must inform the
        <a href="the-referees-role.html">referee</a>
        of their character's alignment, but does not have to tell the other players.
    </p>

    <h2>Role-Playing Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        cPlayers should bear the chosen alignment in mind when determining their character’s actions. The referee may call the player’s attention to deeds that go against the chosen alignment, and may even suggest that the character change to an alignment better fitting to their behaviour. Deviation from alignment may also be penalised, as the referee sees fit.
