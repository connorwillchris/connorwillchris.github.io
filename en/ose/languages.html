    <h1>Languages</h1>
    <p>
        The native languages spoken by a player character are determined by the
        <a href="character-classes.html">character's class</a>.
        These typically include the common tongue and an
        <a href="alignment.html">alignment</a>
        language. Character's with a high INT may learn additional languages (see
        <a href="ability-scores.html">Ability Scores</a>).
    </p>

    <h2>The Common Tongue</h2>
    <p>
        The common tongue (sometimes simply called
        <b>Common</b>)
        is a language which is widespread among intelligent species. All player character races—as well as many monsters—are able to speak Common.
    </p>
    <p>
        In some settings, the
        <a href="the-referees-role.html">referee</a>
        may decide that different cultures in the campaign world use their own language, instead of Common. In this case, characters must choose to speak Common or a specific regional language.
    </p>

    <h2>Alignment Languages</h2>
    <p>
        All intelligent beings know a secret, unwritten language of gestures, signs, and code words associated with their
        <a href="alignment.html">alignment</a>.
        This secret language allows beings of the same alignment to communicate. Beings of another alignment will recognise when an alignment language is being used, but will not understand. It is not possible to learn another alignment language except by changing alignment, in which case the former language is forgotten. 
    </p>

    <h2>Other Languages</h2>
    <p>
        Many demihuman and intelligent monster species have their own langauge, which player characters may be able to learn. The following languages are common and may be chosen by player characters with high Intelligence (at the referee's discretion).
