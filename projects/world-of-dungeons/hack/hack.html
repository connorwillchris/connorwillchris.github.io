    <h1>World of Dungeons - Hack</h1>

    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <h3>Rolling the Dice</h3>
    <p>
        <b>When you attempt something risky,</b>
        sum 2d6 and add one of your attribute scores,
        based on the action you're taking. (The GM
        will tell you some of the possible
        consequences before you roll, so you can
        decide if it's worth the risk or if you want
        to revise your action.)

        <b>A total of 6 or less is a miss;</b>
        things don't go well and the risk turns out
        badly.
        <b>A total of 7-9 is a partial success;</b>
        you do it, but there's some cost, compromise,
        retribution, harm, ect.
        <b>A total of 10 or more is a full
        success;</b>
        you do it without complications.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>SKILLS:</b>
        If you have an applicable skill, you can use
        one of your six stats and you get an additional
        +1 Forward (+1 bonus to your roll until that
        task is resolved).
    </p>

    <h3>DM Rolling Dice</h3>
    <p>
        The DM is allowed to roll dice, usually to
        determine wandering monsters, random monster
        amounts, and other such deductions using d6's.
