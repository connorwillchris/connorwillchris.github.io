    <h1>Game Statistics</h1>
    <p>Player characters are described, in game terms, by a set of statistics that define their abilities, strengths, and weaknesses in the game world.</p>

    <h2>Ability Scores</h2>
    <p>
        The basic physical and mental strengths and weaknesses of a character. There are 6 ability scores:
        <b>Strength</b>
        (abbreviated STR),
        <b>Intelligence</b>
        (INT),
        <b>Wisdom</b>
        (WIS),
        <b>Dexterity</b>
        (DEX),
        <b>Constitution</b>
        (CON), and
        <b>Charisma</b>
        (CHA). A character is ranked in each
        <a>ability score</a>
        by a number between 3-18. (3 being the worst score possible and 18 the best.)
    </p>

    <h2>Class</h2>
    <p>
        An adventuring profession to which the character belongs. A character's class defines their main abilities. See
        <a href="/classes/index.html">Character Classes</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Race</h2>
    <p>
        A character may be human or one of a number of demihuman species. Unless a demihuman class is selected, the character is assumed to be human.
    </p>

    <h2>Level</h2>
    <p>
        The character's experience as an adventurer is denoted by their experience level. Characters typically start play at 1st level (the lowest level of adventurer) and can increase in level through successful adventuring. As a character goes up in level, they gain more powerful abilities, as defined by their class. 
    </p>

    <h2>Experience Points (XP)</h2>
    <p>
        The character's advancement in the game is tracked by the accumulation of
        <a>experience points</a>.
        Experience points are
        <a>awarded</a>
        by the
        <a>referee</a>
        after a successful adventure. When the character has accumulated a certain number of experience points, the character's level increases. Each class specifies the number of experience points required to achieve each experience level.
    </p>

    <h2>Prime Requisite</h2>
    <p>
        The
        <a>ability score</a>
        (or scores) that are the most important to the character's class. The character's score in these abilities can affect the rate at which the character accumulates experience points.
    </p>

    <h2>Alignment</h2>
    <p>
        The character (and every other creature in the game world) is aligned with one of three cosmic principles: Law, Neutrality, or Chaos (see
        <a>Alignment</a>).
        This alignment determines how certain magic influences the character and should be used by the player as a guideline for role-playing the character.
