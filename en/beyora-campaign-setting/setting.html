    <h1>What is Beyora</h1>
    <p>
        <!--The setting made for Japanese players new to OSE.
        <br>-->
        <b>The Pitch:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>
                There was an ancient cataclysm an age ago, and the world has now "reset." People now live in primative tribes. This world is in a late stone age.
            </li>
            <li>
                Technology from civilizations past litter the land. This tech borders on the strange and magical.
            </li>
            <li>
                Iron and iron weapons are antithetical to magic. Anyone who practices magic must avoid iron or else it damages them.
            </li>
        </ul>

    </p>

    <h3>Common Names</h3>
    <p>
        There are no family names, so a person is only given a first name.
    </p>
    <p>
        A person may be given another name if their name conflicts with another, such as two "Aoi" names for example. So their name will be repeated: "Aoiaoi" for example.
