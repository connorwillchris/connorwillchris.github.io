- The most relevant preposition for "about" might be "lon" (e.g., mi toki lon ilo might be translated as "I speak about tools", in the same way that in English you might say "I speak on [the topic of] tools")... but I'm not sure this sentence can be well conveyed in a single sentence.  I don't think "e" really works here - musi e X usually means "to make X amused". 
- Often, a single natlang sentence will require multiple toki pona sentences to translate, and I suspect this is one of those cases. I'd probably make one sentence to state that it's an RPG, and one to state what happens in it (adventuring, monsters, magic)
- "musi RPG" would be "the musi named RPG", so this doesn't work in its current form. You may need to explain what an RPG is briefly in a sentence (or two) to convey this idea.
- For both explaining that it's an RPG and for explaining adventure, monsters, and magic, the key question is to ask yourself: how would I explain this in simpler words, and then say that in toki pona.
